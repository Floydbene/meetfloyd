                        <p>In my first year at Princeton, I learned the basics of OOP in Java and POC in C. Specifically, I learned algorithm
                            design with particular emphasis on algorithms for sorting, searching, graphs, and strings. In C, I learned 
                            systems building, including modular program design, programming style, testing, debugging, and performance tuning. <br><br>

                        <p>Over my junior year, I have gained a comprehensive and practical background for students interested in continuous mathematics for computer science.
                            Specifically, I have taken coursework on higher-level subjects in artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, graphics, and other topics that require numerical computation.<br><br>

                            Beyond that I have done coursework on Combinatorics, probability and graph theory, as well as fundamental concepts in theoretical computer science, 
                            such as NP-completeness and cryptography that arise from the world view of efficient computation. Other applications that I have pursued included
                            convex and other non-linear optimization.<br><br>

                            Finally, I have taken coursework with a focus games on networks, auctions, mechanism and market design, computational social choice. <br><br>

                        I have pursued Machine Learning as an overarching topic, in theoretical coursework, hands-on projects and in my independent research.
                        Specifically, I have studied the mathematical background for handling large datasets and methods of analyzing them using machine learning techniques.
                        Some projects that I have worked on include reinforcement learning-based models for games like chess and multi-output classfication.<br><br>
                        My main area of studies included linear models for classification and regression, support vector machines, neural networks, clustering, principal components analysis, Markov decision processed, planning, and reinforcement learning.
                        In my Independent work, I used machine learning methods to analyze data scraped from social media platforms to predict fluctuations in cryptocurrency markets.<br><br>

                        In the applications field of the Computer Science department, I have done coursework on design, implementation, and evaluation of computer systems, including operating systems, networking, and distributed systems.
                        For the final project in this field, I surveyed several machine-learning based caching algorithms and analyzed their performance using custom traces.
                        Moreover, I created and tested several different types of networking tools, like HTML routers and Python-based servers.<br><br>

                        For my independent work in lieu of a 2-semester thesis, I decided to analyze the correlation/causation between social media impressions 
                        concerning different cryptocurrencies and the tradiung volume, price and other metrics. To do so, I used a variety of statistical methods, 
                        including linear regression.<br><br>
                        Beyond using APIs and scrapers to gather a plethera of posts, comments, likes and other social media options, I used natural language processing to
                        analyze the sentiment and use it as a supporting parameter to train a predictive algorithm for trading volume and price. <br><br>

                        Throughout my 4 years at Princeton, I have gained expertise in a variety of languages. Here is a list of languages and how I have used them:<br><br>
                        <em>Java</em>:<br> I have used Java to learn about algorithm design, implementation and evaluation. My first 2 semesters, all of my coursework was in Java. I am
                        very comfortable with Java.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>C</em>:<br> In connection with script programming and machine code, I learned C as a low-level language, mostly to study principles of memory allocation, security
                        and testing. I feel comfortable creating low-level data structures with in-built memory management and testing suites in C.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Python</em>:<br> Python has been my most used language at Princeton. Specifically, I used it for web development (in conjunction with Flask), machine learning (in conjunction
                        with PyTorch, SciPy and TensorFlow), data analysis (in conjunction with Numpy and Pandas) and statistics and modelling (in conjunction with Numpy, MatPlotLib, seaborn and many more)
                        I am most comfortable with Python.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</em>:<br> I have developed several webpages and done a large amount of tutorials using the HTML/CSS/JavaScript suite. I feel very compfortable with 
                        those three languages and have experience with Node.js, React.js, AJAX, JQuery and Bootstrap (Most of which I used on this website).
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Go</em>:<br> I used Golang in the context of a project-based class, where I created a few differnt applications in Go, including Socket Programming,
                        an In-Memory Cache, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and a Database Connection Pool. I have some experience writing Golang
